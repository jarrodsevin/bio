          <h2>Leader of People</h2>
          <h3>Operational Expert • Problem Solver • Team Builder</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
          I’m a hands-on leader who has spent over two decades cultivating leadership through people development, operational excellence, and team building. I believe in working side by side with teams, modeling behaviors and expectations that drive long-term success. My leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership — empowering individuals to perform their roles correctly and efficiently by providing the right tools, support, and autonomy. I strive to create an environment where people feel trusted and supported, while knowing I’m engaged and available when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I’ve mentored many emerging leaders by being fully present, listening deeply, and helping them arrive at their own answers through thoughtful dialogue. I guide through questions rather than directives — encouraging long-term thinking, personal ownership, and confidence in their own capabilities. Leadership to me isn’t just about hitting KPIs; it’s about growing people who can solve problems, build trust, and elevate those around them.
        </p>

        <h3>Career Milestones</h3>
        <p>
          At <strong>Northern Tool + Equipment</strong>, I was honored with both <strong>Store Manager of the Year</strong> and <strong>Store of the Year</strong> distinctions — selected from a pool of over 120 locations nationwide. These awards were based on performance in key retail metrics including top-line revenue, year-over-year sales comps, warranty penetration, shrink control, and internal audit excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my proudest accomplishments was earning a <strong>Top 3 performance score</strong> during an intensive internal audit conducted by corporate leadership at Northern Tool + Equipment. These audits measured safety compliance, operational consistency, and executional discipline — areas in which I’ve maintained industry-leading standards across multiple years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also entrusted to relocate to Florida to help launch a brand-new division for Northern Tool + Equipment — the <strong>Field Service Team</strong>. This initiative was built from the ground up and involved hiring and developing a team of remote field service professionals, creating structured workflows, and implementing efficient quoting systems. I led business development efforts with corporate clients, developed pricing strategies, and oversaw multi-phase, high-value service projects from concept through completion. These initiatives often spanned months and required hands-on leadership, coordination, and long-term operational oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <strong>Regional Service Manager</strong>, I was responsible for the sales and operations of 22 service centers across 7 states. I held full P&L accountability, developed sales strategies, optimized warranty performance, maintained high operational standards, and personally handled high-priority customer escalations. This role demanded strong regional coordination and consistency in service excellence across all locations.
        </p>

        <h3>Recognitions</h3>
        <p>
          At <strong>Northern Tool + Equipment</strong>, I was consistently recognized for leadership, execution, and talent development. As a <strong>Regional Training Manager</strong>, I played a key role in onboarding and mentoring newly promoted and externally hired store managers. These leaders would begin their structured development in my store, where I worked closely with them on operations, leadership presence, and cultural alignment. I later joined them in their home locations for in-market coaching, giving them personalized follow-through and support as they took ownership of their stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          This program not only helped shape the next generation of field leaders, it also shaped me — sharpening my ability to scale mentorship and tailor my coaching to various leadership styles. It was one of the most fulfilling responsibilities of my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I was frequently selected to serve as the <strong>Regional New Store Opening Manager</strong> for Northern Tool + Equipment, where I became the go-to expert for launching new locations. I mentored brand-new store managers and teams—most of whom were entering the company for the first time. My leadership spanned every phase of store readiness: merchandising, inventory control, visual setups, planogram execution, team onboarding, sales training, and operational processes. I was trusted to be the one who brought order, energy, and culture to a new location from day one.
